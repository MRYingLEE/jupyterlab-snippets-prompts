# **JupyterLab Code Snippets**

## **Save, reuse, and share code snippets using JupyterLab Code Snippets**

JupyterLab Code Snippets stores reusable pieces of code and saves you from typing repetitive code via two new methods: inserting code cells and pasting code. Code snippets are reusable pieces of code, individual cells, or blocks of cells. Simply browse or search snippets to use in your existing notebooks or start a completely new notebook with snippets.

Do you find yourself typing in the same code blocks over and over again? Are you tired of clicking through tabs online for API starter code or browsing old notebook files to find the right import statements? In the past, there was no easy way to keep track of copied code. You would spend more time scouring the internet than actually working. Searching old code for snippets is like searching for your lost keys; it’s frustrating! 

We hear you! Now, you can save, organize, and manage your snippets to separate function or project-based folders and use either of the following methods to put your snippets into your notebooks. You can insert code cells into notebooks while preserving the cell structure by dragging and dropping. Or, you can copy code into your clipboard and paste it into any JupyterLab workspace. The extension also allows teams to easily send, receive, and share snippets.

Using code snippets is easy, simply open the snippet explorer and explore some of the predefined code snippets available. Not finding what you need? Highlight code or code cells to create new snippets. Flag your most-used snippets to prioritize them. The snippets will then be easy to search for and readily available to drag and drop or paste wherever they’re needed.

*“I’ve grown accustomed to opening an old notebook and searching through it in order to find the necessary import statements every time I start a new project. But, with the JupyterLab Code Snippets extension, I saved a lot of time by storing them as snippets and inserting them directly into my workflow.”*

This new extension gives users the ability to seamlessly incorporate code snippets. Equipped with a drag and drop interface, easy searching functions, and more, users will no longer have to fumble through notebooks to find commonly used pieces of code. Save time, save energy, and get down to business with JupyterLab Code Snippets!
